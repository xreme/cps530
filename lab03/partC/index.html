                    After developing the same website in both Pure HTML & CSS and also in Bootstrap CSS. I have a 
                    better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of both options. 
                </p>
                <p style="width: 95%;">
                    Developing the webpage with regular CSS initially was relatively straightforward; place elements on the
                    page, and try to make it look good. This task was made more difficult when implementing responsiveness
                    to the page. Since we were to do this in pure HTML and CSS, I had to manually implement fluid grids.
                    This manual implemetation meant that I was in full control of how wide I wanted each column
                    to be. I was also in control of how I wanted the different elements to shift around the page at different 
                    breakpoints. This granular control meant that I could really set things up how I wanted them to be,
                    at the cost of the time it takes to to do it, and the complexity it adds. 
                </p>
                <p style="width: 95%;">
                    Developing using a framework like bootstrap means you sacrifice control for speed & efficieny. While developing the 
                    page with Bootstrap I felt that I was able to move a lot faster. Bootstrap CSS
                    takes a lot of the troubles of setting up responsivenes and gives a simple method of utilizing it. This is nice when 
                    trying to get things up and running quickly, but also became very frustrating when I ran into a problem.
                    While setting up the respsonsiveness for the page bootstrap CSS was unable to align some text in
                    just the right way, and even when trying to do the alignment manually with regular CSS, the bootstrap componenets
                    started to clash with the code. After some investigation, I learned that the version of bootstrap I was using(the one in the slides) 
                    didn't support the alignment, but I was able to use a newer version of bootstrap that fixed the issue. This is the type of problem
                    that I find especially annoying with abstractions; when you don't really know what's going on under the hood
                    troubleshooting becomes much more difficult.

                    Overall I enjoyed using Bootstrap, it is a very powerful tool, that takes some of difficulty out from 
                    making good looking, responsive webpages.
